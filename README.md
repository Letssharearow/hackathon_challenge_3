## FAQ

* What is a hackathon?
It's a one day event where you can team up with several friends and try to build a prototype for an actual hands-on problem provided by industrial partners. Meet new people and use new frameworks!
* Do I need to form a team beforehand?
No. You can organize in advance and come as a team or find a team at the start of the event.
* What's in it for me?
Fun, experience, possbility to extend your professional network, meet people from the industry and learn what they are working on. Also, there are prizes for the best solutions.
* What should I bring?
We provide food and drinks, but you need to have your own computer with you to work on the problems. We also offer some GPU compute on CAIRO THWS server but you need to have at least one [MAI](https://mai.thws.de/en/) student on your team to access it.

## Future Hackathons

We are constantly looking for new industrial partners. If you think you have a problem that could be solved with artificial intelligence and might be available for rapid prototyping, fill [this form](https://forms.gle/WNRBabQK7rs5JiDp9) describe your company and your suggested problem and we will reach out to you and invite as a partner to some future hackathon.
