Title: Dialog-based HSPE application completion tool

Problem: Applications are often filled out incorrectly, incompletely, or ambiguously; the purpose and necessity of various pieces of information are not always clear to applicants; Further work cannot be carried out with the preliminary results; subsequent additions and clarifications are often necessary, leading to delays.

Example: Application for employment (or qualification agreement, supplementary form)
Reference: e.g., apps such as Steuerbot

Goal: Clarity regarding (1) which documents and information (2) are required in what form, and (3) why; complete and correct applications that can be processed immediately.

Challenge: Some processing of personal/sensitive/confidential data, therefore a secure environment without third-party insight/access is essential; one-time development effort because HSPE must provide training data and format it correctly.

Added value: Smoother process execution, time savings, increased efficiency for all process participants.

The examples of the forms to be filled are in the repo.
