Challenge:
Self-learning information hub for employees based on AI agents/other AI solutions

You are tasked to desing a personal assistant for the local energy company.

Here is the list of potential features:
* Automation of manual work/replacement for searches using tools like Google Alerts
* Continuous (web) searches for customizable keywords/topics
* Option to connect to other defined/appropriate sources (e.g., social media channels, new legal texts, or regulations) that are searched for relevant information
* Continuous self-learning search improvements -> e.g., optionally offer related/logically related topics and, similarly to social media, continue based on feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down)
* Results can be accessed either in the web interface by keyword/topic/overview or as an automated newsletter event-based/automatically delivered in fixed cycles
* Displayed timeline can be customized
* Prioritization can generate push events after a trigger is triggered
* Individually configurable at any time, as each user has different requirements
* Further expansion levels are conceivable, including chat with results ala LLM of questions like "Prepare a dossier for my next municipal support appointment in municipality X based on my previous notes, new sources since date x, and data stored on server x, y, and z."

Possible example case as a basis for the hackathon:

User: Position: Corporate Development / Municipal Support in an energy supplier

Initial keywords/topic areas could be, for example:
* All municipalities I support
* All municipalities that are in our focus for municipal support
* All mayors within the municipalities we support
* All affected districts
* Specific individuals
* My company
* Other defined companies
* Other (local) energy suppliers
* Local energy news
* National energy news
* Networks in the area in which we participate
* Other work-relevant topics such as
* Risk management
* Regional AI
* National AI
* Cooperatives
* GVB
* Sustainability management
