Conflicts often arise in teams during collaboration. Conflicts, in turn, lead to inefficiencies and poor work results, perhaps even to increased turnover or employee resignation. Traditional approach: Supervisors handle conflicts within their teams. Some companies also employ external coaches or team developers. Employees learn new possibilities and methods through training.

Possible AI assistance vision: It would be nice if every employee had free access to a tool that supports them in conflicts in the work context. Ideally, the tool is freely available (e.g., based on a freely available version of a common LLM) and can be operated via text or voice. Optional: It would be nice if this tool were not perceived by employees as indoctrination, but rather offered various options for customization.

For example: Supervisor/management specifies one day per week for home office. Employees want to work from home more than one day a week.
