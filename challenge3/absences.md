Predictive analytics for long-term absences: Early detection of long-term illness-related absences through intelligent analysis of HR data

Long-term employee absences pose significant operational and economic challenges for companies: unplanned staffing shortages, increased workload for the remaining team, project delays, and high costs for replacement staff. Currently, such absences are usually handled reactively once they have already occurred. The key challenge: Can AI/algorithms be used to identify patterns/anomalies from the data available in the HR department (days of absence, absence patterns, frequencies, etc.) that enable early detection of long-term absences? We are looking for innovative data analysis approaches based exclusively on HR data â€“ without access to medical information or sensitive health data.

Primary objective: Development of a forecasting system for the early detection of long-term absences (> 6 weeks).
Key performance indicators: Accuracy rate of at least 70% in predicting long-term absences; early warning at least 4-8 weeks before the expected long-term absence; reduction of unplanned staff shortages by 50%.
Secondary objectives: Identification of risk groups and patterns; derivation of preventive measures for health management; optimization of staff planning.
