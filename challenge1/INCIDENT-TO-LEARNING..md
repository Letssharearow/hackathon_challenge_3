INCIDENT-TO-LEARNING

Quality Incidents (Defects) are very valuable source (“goldmine”) for Learning, Prevention and Continuous Improvement. Based on Quality Incidents Lessons Learned (LL) are created, handshaked / included into the concepts of upcoming new car models / derivates. Now LL is effective in terms of years. We want it to be effective in terms of days or months.
IDEA:

Additionally to the current LL process use AI to
• evaluate Quality Incidents immediately
• generate LL in Form of Best-Practice Documents, Learning Videos etc.
• and distribute the LL to the relevant recipients like development, quality or supplier
